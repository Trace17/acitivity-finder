# Date Finder
This is an application using Django Web Framework to build both the backend and frontend of a web application which finds a random activity or random date idea based on a users location and any specific options they are interested in. 
## Uses
This application is meant to be used by people who are looking for a spontaneous and random activity or date. Often times when trying to find something to do, analysis paralysis kicks in, at first I thought this was only a problem for me until it became a trend on social media for users to pick a random number to decide on what to do for that day, this application is a modified version of that!
